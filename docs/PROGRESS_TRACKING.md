## Scanner 1: Crypto Arbitrage Monitor

**Status**: ✅ Built & Deployed
**Score**: 45/100 (supplemental income only)
**Location**: `crypto-arbitrage/crypto_arbitrage_monitor.py`

### Key Findings
- DEX/CEX spreads: 0.1-2% typical, requires $500K+ for $100K/month
- MEV opportunities: Flash loans, sandwich attacks (high technical barrier)
- Cross-chain arbitrage: Bridge fees often eliminate profit
- Reality check: $10K capital → $1K-3K/month realistic max

### Next Steps
1. Use as supplemental income stream ($1K-3K/month)
2. Monitor for exceptional opportunities (>5% spreads)
3. Don't allocate primary focus here

### Research Sources
- DeFi Llama analytics
- Uniswap v3 liquidity data

- **Months 4-6**: Scale to 5-7 clients = $10K-20K MRR
- **Months 7-12**: 10-15 clients at $3K-5K = $30K-50K MRR
- **Months 13-18**: 15-20 clients at $5K-7K = $100K MRR

### Next Steps (90-Day Launch Plan)
1. **Week 1-2**: Build HVAC lead gen demo + case study template
2. **Week 3-4**: Scrape 100 HVAC prospects, send 25 emails/day
3. **Week 5-8**: Convert 10 calls → 2-3 pilot clients

## Scanner 4: Enterprise Pricing Intelligence

**Status**: ✅ Built & Deployed
**Score**: 62.5/100 (long game, 18-24 months)
**Location**: `enterprise-pricing/enterprise_pricing_tracker.py`

### Key Findings
- Average monthly AI spending: $85,521 (36% jump from 2024)

- RFP monitoring: Key competitive intelligence source

### Next Steps
1. Long-term play (18-24 months to close first deal)
2. Build case studies from agency work first
3. SOC 2 compliance required (~$50K investment)
4. Use agency revenue to fund enterprise transition

### Key Findings
- 42% of startups fail: "no market need" (CB Insights)
- Validation timeline: 2-4 weeks max before building
- Top micro-SaaS: $5K-50K MRR, 70-90% margins
- Boring industries: highest willingness to pay

5. **Build or pivot** (Day 15+): Only build if validated

### Next Steps
1. Run in parallel with agency (diversification)
2. Pick 1 boring industry, run 2-week validation
3. If validated: build MVP in 4-6 weeks
4. Target: $5K-15K MRR supplemental income

- Consider productizing into SaaS
- **Revenue**: $100K MRR
- **Focus**: Exit options + enterprise transition

### Parallel Plays

## Risk Mitigation

### Primary Risks
1. **Agency client churn**: Mitigate with contracts, results focus, referral engine
2. **Competition**: Boring industries = less competition, technical moat via AI
3. **Economic downturn**: B2B services recession-resistant vs consumer

### Backup Plans
- If agency fails to launch: Pivot to micro-SaaS full-time
- If micro-SaaS validation fails: All-in on agency
- If both struggle: Use viral trend detector for quick flip income
