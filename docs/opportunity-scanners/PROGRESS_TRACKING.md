## Scanner 1: Crypto Arbitrage Monitor

**Status**: ✅ Built & Deployed
**Score**: 45/100 (supplemental income only)
**Location**: `crypto-arbitrage/crypto_arbitrage_monitor.py`

### Key Findings
- DEX/CEX spreads: 0.1-2% typical, requires $500K+ for $100K/month
- MEV opportunities: Flash loans, sandwich attacks (high technical barrier)
- Cross-chain arbitrage: Bridge fees often eliminate profit
- Reality check: $10K capital → $1K-3K/month realistic max

### Next Steps
1. Use as supplemental income stream ($1K-3K/month)
2. Monitor for exceptional opportunities (>5% spreads)
3. Don't allocate primary focus here

### Research Sources
- DeFi Llama analytics
- Uniswap v3 liquidity data
