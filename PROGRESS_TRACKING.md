## Scanner 1: Crypto Arbitrage Monitor

**Status**: ✅ Built & Deployed
**Score**: 45/100 (supplemental income only)
**Location**: `crypto-arbitrage/crypto_arbitrage_monitor.py`

### Key Findings
- DEX/CEX spreads: 0.1-2% typical, requires $500K+ for $100K/month
- MEV opportunities: Flash loans, sandwich attacks (high technical barrier)
- Cross-chain arbitrage: Bridge fees often eliminate profit
- Reality check: $10K capital → $1K-3K/month realistic max

### Next Steps
1. Use as supplemental income stream ($1K-3K/month)
2. Monitor for exceptional opportunities (>5% spreads)
3. Don't allocate primary focus here

### Research Sources
- DeFi Llama analytics
- Uniswap v3 liquidity data

**Status**: ✅ Built & Deployed
**Score**: 79.75/100 (HIGHEST - PRIMARY PATH)
**Location**: `ai-agency-leads/ai_agency_lead_generator.py`

### Key Findings

  - Seasonal demand spikes

### Path to $100K/Month
- **Months 1-3**: 2-3 clients at $1.5K-3K = $4.5K-9K MRR
- **Months 4-6**: Scale to 5-7 clients = $10K-20K MRR
- **Months 7-12**: 10-15 clients at $3K-5K = $30K-50K MRR
- **Months 13-18**: 15-20 clients at $5K-7K = $100K MRR

### Next Steps (90-Day Launch Plan)
1. **Week 1-2**: Build HVAC lead gen demo + case study template
2. **Week 3-4**: Scrape 100 HVAC prospects, send 25 emails/day

3. **Brand Authority**: Use to position as builder/innovator

### Next Steps
1. Build micro-tools for HVAC agency demos (viral-ish in niche)

- **Mid-market**: $5K-10K/month (3-6 month close)
- **Enterprise**: Avoid unless funded/established

### Key Findings
- **Top Micro-SaaS Ideas Validated**:
  1. HVAC scheduling widget (pain: 8.5/10, buildable in 2-4 weeks)
  2. Dental patient follow-up bot (pain: 7.5/10, regulatory considerations)
  3. Service business invoice automation (pain: 7/10, crowded space)

- **Time to $10K MRR**:

  - Micro-SaaS: 9-18 months

### Strategic Recommendation
