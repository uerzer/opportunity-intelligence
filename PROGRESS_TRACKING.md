## Capital Allocation Recommendation

**Current Capital**: $10K available
**Recommended Allocation**:
- 80% ($8K) → AI Agency Launch
  - $2K: Tools/software (CRM, automation stack)
  - $2K: Lead generation/outreach
  - $2K: Demo development
  - $2K: Buffer for client pilots
- 15% ($1.5K) → Crypto Arbitrage (test capital)
- 5% ($500) → Emergency buffer

**ROI Projection**:
- Month 3: $4.5K-9K MRR from agency
- Month 6: $10K-20K MRR
- Month 12: $30K-50K MRR
- Month 18: $100K MRR target

## Risk Mitigation

### Primary Risks
1. **Client acquisition slower than projected**
   - Mitigation: Over-prospect (150+ targets), offer free pilots
2. **Service delivery complexity**
   - Mitigation: Start with single service (lead gen only), expand later
3. **Competitive pressure**
   - Mitigation: Niche down (HVAC only initially), build moat via results
4. **Cash flow gaps**
   - Mitigation: 50% upfront payments, monthly retainers

### Backup Plans
- **Plan B**: If agency slow, pivot to enterprise pricing tool (3-month timeline)
- **Plan C**: If B2B hard, launch micro-SaaS validated product (60-day build)
- **Plan D**: Crypto arbitrage as supplemental income ($1K-3K/month)
