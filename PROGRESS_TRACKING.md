## Scanner 1: Crypto Arbitrage Monitor

**Status**: ✅ Built & Deployed
**Score**: 45/100 (supplemental income only)
**Location**: `crypto-arbitrage/crypto_arbitrage_monitor.py`

### Key Findings

- **Months 4-6**: Scale to 5-7 clients = $10K-20K MRR
- **Months 7-12**: 10-15 clients at $3K-5K = $30K-50K MRR
- **Months 13-18**: 15-20 clients at $5K-7K = $100K MRR

### Next Steps (90-Day Launch Plan)
1. **Week 1-2**: Build HVAC lead gen demo + case study template
