## 🎯 Strategic Recommendations

**PRIMARY PATH: AI Automation Agency**
- **Why:** Highest score (79.75/100), fastest path to $10K/month (90 days)
- **Target:** HVAC companies first (highest pain + budget)
- **Differentiator:** Focus on "boring" industries with low competition
- **Validation:** $2K-7K/month pricing confirmed via market research

**SECONDARY PATH: Micro-SaaS**
- **Why:** Solid score (72.25/100), scalable product asset
- **Target:** Manufacturing compliance, florist inventory, mobile detailing
- **Timeline:** 12-24 months to $100K MRR
- **Entry:** 2-4 week validation, $5K-15K pre-sales before building

**AVOID (Unless Conditions Met):**
- **Crypto Arbitrage:** Requires $500K+ capital for meaningful returns
- **Enterprise AI:** Needs existing $50K-100K/month business + SOC 2 certification
