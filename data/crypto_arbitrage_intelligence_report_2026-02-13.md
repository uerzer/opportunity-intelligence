================================================================================

1. DEX-DEX ARBITRAGE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Typical Spreads: 0.1-0.8%
Execution Speed: seconds
Capital Required: $10000+

PROFIT CALCULATION:
  Spread: 0.5%
  Trade Size: $10,000
  Gross Profit: $50.00
  Net Profit Range: $10.00 - $30.00

TOOLS NEEDED:
  • ArbitrageScanner.io ($69-795/mo)
  • Real-time price feeds (WebSocket)
  • Flash loan integration (Aave V3)
  • MEV protection (Flashbots)


2. CEX-DEX ARBITRAGE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: Buy cheap on CEX, sell high on DEX (or reverse)
Typical Spreads: 0.5-2%
Execution Speed: minutes
Capital Required: $10000+

PROFIT CALCULATION:
  Spread: 1.5%
  Trade Size: $10,000
  Gross Profit: $150.00
  Net Profit Range: $50.00 - $100.00

BEST OPPORTUNITIES:
  • High Volatility Tokens: Newly listed tokens, low liquidity pairs
  • Regional Price Gaps: Asia vs US market hours
  • Event Driven: Token listings, delistings, airdrops


3. CROSS-CHAIN ARBITRAGE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: Price differences for same asset on different chains
Typical Spreads: 1-3%
Execution Speed: 10-30 minutes
Capital Required: $10000+

PROFIT CALCULATION:
  Spread: 2%

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: Front-run, back-run, or sandwich profitable transactions
Typical Spreads: 0.1-5% per opportunity
Execution Speed: milliseconds
Capital Required: $50000+ (high capital efficiency)

⚠️  REALITY CHECK:
  • Competition: Top MEV bots capture 80%+ of opportunities
  • Capital Required: $50K-500K for meaningful profits
  • Technical Barrier: Extremely high - Rust/Go, low-latency infra
  • Ethical Concerns: Sandwich attacks harm retail traders
  • Recommendation: Not recommended for solo operators with <$100K


================================================================================
INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

ESSENTIAL INFRASTRUCTURE:

Price Monitoring:
  Tools: ArbitrageScanner.io ($69-795/mo), Custom WebSocket feeds
  Cost: $100-1,000/month

Execution:
  Tools: Web3.py/Ethers.js, Private RPC nodes (Alchemy/Infura)
  Cost: $50-500/month

Capital:
  Tools: DEX liquidity, CEX accounts (KYC)
  Cost: $10000 working capital


ADVANCED INFRASTRUCTURE (OPTIONAL):

Flash Loans:
  Tools: Aave V3, dYdX, Uniswap V3 flash swaps
  Benefit: Borrow capital for single transaction, no upfront capital needed
  Cost: 0.05-0.09% flash loan fee

Mev Protection:
  Tools: Flashbots RPC, MEV-Blocker
  Benefit: Prevent being front-run
  Cost: Free

Automated Execution:
  Tools: Gelato Network, Chainlink Automation, Custom bots
  Cost: $100-1,000/month


================================================================================
RECOMMENDED ACTION PLAN
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Next 7 Days):
  1. Sign up for ArbitrageScanner.io trial
  2. Monitor DEX-DEX spreads on Ethereum/BSC for 1 week
  3. Calculate actual net profits after all fees
  4. Test with $100-500 to validate strategy

30-DAY PLAN:
  1. Build automated monitoring system
  2. Identify 3-5 consistently profitable pairs
  3. Optimize gas usage and execution speed
  4. Scale capital as strategy proves out


================================================================================
⚠️  REALITY CHECK
================================================================================
Crypto arbitrage is highly competitive. Expect 5-15% monthly returns with $10K capital, not $100K monthly revenue. Consider combining with other strategies.


================================================================================
PATH TO SCALE
================================================================================

1. Start with $10K, target 10-15% monthly
2. Compound returns for 12-18 months
3. Build proprietary strategies and infrastructure
4. Scale to $100K+ capital base
5. Alternative: Use flash loans for zero-capital arbitrage (advanced)


================================================================================
KEY INSIGHTS
================================================================================

1. DEX-DEX arbitrage offers the fastest execution (seconds) but smallest spreads (0.1-0.8%)
2. CEX-DEX arbitrage has higher spreads (0.5-2%) but faces withdrawal delays and fees
3. Cross-chain arbitrage shows 1-3% spreads but bridge fees eat into profits significantly
4. MEV opportunities are highly competitive and require $50K+ capital for meaningful returns
5. With $10K capital, realistic target is 5-15% monthly, not $100K monthly revenue
6. Flash loans can eliminate capital requirements but require advanced technical skills
7. 70% of arbitrage is bot-driven - speed and automation are critical for success
