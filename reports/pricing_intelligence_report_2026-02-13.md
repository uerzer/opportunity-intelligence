## Market Insights

### Key Findings
- Average pricing gap between SMB and Enterprise tiers is 5-10x
- Mid-market segment ($100-500/mo ARR potential) consistently underserved
- Buyers willing to pay 2-3x for reliability + team features without complexity
- AI/ML tooling shows highest opportunity score (92/100)
- Usage-based pricing creating anxiety - flat tiers preferred for budget predictability

### Market Patterns
- Freemium to Enterprise jump: Most products have weak mid-tier offerings
- Team features paywall: Collaboration locked behind expensive plans
- Support quality gap: Chat support vs. dedicated CSM with nothing between
- Implementation complexity: Enterprise tools require consultants, SMB tools too limited

### Winning Strategies
- Launch at $299-599/mo sweet spot with generous limits
- Offer predictable flat pricing with 'fair use' caps
- Include team features from day one (5-10 seats)
- Provide white-glove onboarding without ongoing CSM requirement
- Target Series A-B companies and 20-100 person bootstrapped companies

### Risk Factors
- Incumbents may expand mid-market offerings if successful
- Sales motion: Self-serve vs light-touch sales unclear
- Customer acquisition cost may be high in competitive categories
- Product differentiation critical - pricing alone won't win

## Recommended Next Steps
- Deep-dive research on AI/ML development platform competitors
- Interview 10-15 potential customers in top-scored categories
- Build pricing comparison matrix for top 3 categories
- Calculate TAM/SAM for mid-market segment in each category
- Prototype MVP for highest-scoring opportunity
