## Pricing Frameworks


### Cost Plus Model
- **Formula:** (Infrastructure + Team + Overhead) × 2-3x margin
- **Example:** $50K monthly cost → $100K-150K customer price

**Pros:**
- Simple to calculate
- Covers all costs
- Predictable

**Cons:**
- Leaves money on table if value is high
- Commoditizes offering

### Value Based Model
- **Formula:** 10-30% of value created/saved
- **Example:** If agent saves $500K annually → $50K-150K annual fee

**Pros:**
- Aligns with customer outcomes
- Premium pricing justified

**Cons:**
- Requires ROI proof
- Harder to sell upfront

### Tiered Saas Model

**Starter Tier:**
- Price: $5,000-$10,000/month

**Professional Tier:**
- Price: $15,000-$30,000/month
- Includes: Advanced features, 50K interactions/mo, Slack support, SLA
- Target: Growing companies, production use

**Enterprise Tier:**
- Price: $50,000-$150,000/month
- Includes: Custom development, unlimited interactions, 24/7 support, SOC2, dedicated team

### Hybrid Model
- **Platform Fee:** $10,000-$25,000/month
- **Usage Fee:** $0.10-$1.00 per interaction
- **Implementation:** $50,000-$200,000 one-time
