Crypto Arbitrage Opportunity Monitor
Tracks DEX/CEX price spreads, MEV opportunities, and cross-chain arbitrage

Key Findings from Research:
- ArbitrageScanner.io: $69-795/mo, covers 75+ CEX, 25+ DEX, 20 blockchains
- Typical spreads: 0.3-0.8% on major pairs, 2%+ during volatility
- Minimum capital: $5K-10K for profitable trades after fees
- 70% of arbitrage is bot-driven, speed is critical
- Cross-chain opportunities exist but bridge fees/delays eat profits
